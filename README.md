# Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring: Terraform,Ansible, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana.

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using Git, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate software deployment, scaling, and operations across a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, the pipeline includes monitoring of Jenkins jobs with Prometheus and Grafana for enhanced observability.

**Challenges Addressed**
* Increasing Demand: The company required a platform to handle increased demand for their product, which utilized Docker containers.
* Monolithic Architecture: Previously, they used a monolithic architecture with manual deployments.
* Version Control: Implementing a Git workflow for version control and controlled releases.

**Solution Implemented**
* CI/CD Pipeline: A Jenkins pipeline automates the entire deployment lifecycle.
* Git Integration: Version control is implemented with Git, triggering builds on commits to the master branch.
* Dockerization: Dockerfiles containerize the application code for deployment.
* Kubernetes Deployment: Containerized code gets deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with two replicas.
* NodePort Service: A NodePort service exposes the application on port 30008.
* Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform manages infrastructure creation on AWS.
* Configuration Management: Ansible deploys necessary software and configurations on servers.
* Monitoring Integration: Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring Jenkins jobs. Prometheus collects metrics from Jenkins, and Grafana provides dashboards for visualizing these metrics.
  
**Monitoring Integration**
â€¢	Prometheus and Grafana: Monitoring of Jenkins jobs is integrated using Prometheus and Grafana.
   o	Prometheus Setup: Prometheus is configured to scrape Jenkins metrics and store them.
   o	Grafana Dashboard: Grafana is set up to visualize Jenkins metrics, including job performance, build duration, and failure rates.


**Key Technologies**
* CI/CD Tool: Jenkins
* Version Control: Git
* Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Containerization: Docker
* Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
* Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

**Project Outcomes**
* Automated Deployment: Streamlined the deployment process for faster releases.
* Scalability: Enabled easy scaling to handle increased demand.
* Improved Efficiency: Reduced manual intervention and improved operational efficiency.
* Enhanced Observability: Provided real-time monitoring and insights into Jenkins job performance and system health.

**Documentation**: A detailed PDF document "Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring: Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana" outlines the complete deployment process with screenshots. 

By showcasing this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and manage complex DevOps CI/CD pipelines for efficient and scalable application deployments.
